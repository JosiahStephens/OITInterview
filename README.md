Hang Man Game

Time â€” 2 hours

First, I made a loop with the PlayHangman function. I did this to make sure that the loop was working beforehand. Then I coded the PlayHangman function. This function has a loop that checks for input errors and evaluates the input. As I did this I decided to make some functions to handle input and some of the output in order to declutter the code. The function continues until the player is able to guess the entire word.

Without being too excessive, I tried to document my thinking in my code comments.
